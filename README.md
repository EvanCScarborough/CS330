# CS330
A portfolio artifact from my CS-330 class.


1. How do I approach designing software?
The struggles I faced while working on this project were a learning experience in a variety of ways. One of the most important things I learned is how vital it is to keep your files organized. Some of my issues with this project could likely have been avoided if I had been more intentional with where I saved what. Additionally, I should have been more on top of communication from my professor, as there were some updates throughout the course that I missed which would have saved me some serious headaches. Despite these difficulties, I was able to get a feel for designing software using OpenGL during this course. I learned to take partially completed but unfamiliar code, read through it to determine what it's doing and how, and plan based on that how to implement the required functionality. All of these skills are pretty universally applicable in the software development field; organization is key, and it's rare that software is written entirely from scratch, so being able to read and understand code you did not write is essential.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
Since the program for this project was not especially complex, I was able to confim the implementation of required features using manual testing. When writing code, I would start by working from the guides provided. If I got stuck from there, I would attempt to find an example of something similar in the textbook or online that I could model my solution off of.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
As an aspiring software developer, a strong knowledge of computer science is extremely important for me. This class has given me a foundation in 3D computer graphics which can be applied to a large number of different types of projects, such as video games, simulations, and CGI for film. I have already begun to apply some of what I've learned in this class to my personal projects. Having the opportunity to take a look "under the hood" at C++ graphics code has given me a new appreciation for the art, and helps to contextualize my approach to graphical problems, even in situations where those processes are more abstracted.
